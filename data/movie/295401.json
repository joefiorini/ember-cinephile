Like an abundance of Swedes her age, she has fled the mass unemployment of her home country in search of a more worthwhile existence in a nouveau-riche Oslo. But her new life is caught in deadlock - Dino finds herself stuck in a destructive loop of temporary jobs, financial trouble and hard partying. A broken arm incidentally leads to a position as a housekeeper in a Norwegian middle-class home. Dino is thrown into a reality very far from her own. During a few sultry summer weeks she ends up the centre of an odd love triangle, an unpredictable struggle for affection as well as dominance. \"Underdog\" is a tender and raw story of privilege and longing, yet at the same time a humorous and unmerciful observation of the shifted power balance between Sweden and Norway - an actuality where Swedes have become the Norwegians' servants.","popularity":0.26072585495468,"poster_path":"/1c0LBLRsq1coNPodZOj9ikswwmj.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Anagram Films","id":19956}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2015-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Underdog","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
